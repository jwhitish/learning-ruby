	puts "Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a gameboard\n with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. Each player begins with 16 pieces: \none king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. \n\nThe objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an \ninescapable threat of capture. To this end, a player's pieces are used to \nattack and capture the opponent's pieces. The game ends when one player \ncaptures the other player's King, there are no legal moves remaining, or \none player declares defeat.\n\n"
